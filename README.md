This project intakes an image, seperates each column of pixels of the image into an array, then scrambles the array. Then use the image to visulize the sorting algorithm.

The idea of the general workflow of the program
- Imports a const image from a folder (The program will not minipulate the imported image file)
- Copies the image for manipulation
- Seperates the image into individual columns of pixels
- Randomizes the columns
- Visualize the sorting of the image (Add different sorting algorithms to choose from?)
- (Maybe add sound effects too?)
- Show final image resorted and allow the user to restart/exit program
